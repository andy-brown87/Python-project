# Food Takeaway

Youâ€™ve been tasked with making an order management system for a takeaway. This takeaway takes orders over the phone and enters them into the system for the kitchen to cook them and to keep track of them. 

## MVP

You should be able to create an `Customer` with a name, phone number, address, and a list of `Order`s.

A `Customer` should be able to place several `Order`s and an `Order` should contain a list of `Item`s (an item should have a name and a price).

There should be a page where you can see all `Customer`s and be able to click through to each `Customer` to see the details of their `Orders` and where you should be able to edit or delete the `Order`. You should be able to edit and delete `Customer`s

## Extensions:

- Be able to order multiples of an item
- Be able to add up total for an order
- Be able to set an order as dispatched and delivered

<!-- you should add the following to your readme -->
<!-- 1. context to the program, what is this, when did you do it, what are the technoglies used/what is needed to run the app-->
<!-- 2. some screen shots of the app, even better a youtube video, even even better host it online but that's like a whole project of it's own -->
<!-- 3. a _STEP_ by _STEP_ guide on how to get the app running-->
<!-- 4. add a seed  file so if someone wants to checkout your app they have some data to work with-->
